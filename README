Simple Search Engine

Simple search engine based on Boolean Retrieval and Vector Space Retrieval.

filename - vector_space.py

Place the file in the parent folder of the "nsf award abstracts"

Run the file as 

python vector_space.py

Initial Index will be created for about 25 seconds.

TF IDF calculation and construction of tfidf vectors for all files will happen in another 55 seconds.

After this, query prompt will open up.

query structure is "<bool/vector> query"

bool searches in boolean way, while option "vector" computes cosine similarity for all documents, ranks them and prints the top 50 results.

Example queries

1) bool stephen palumbi

2) vector ricardo osuna


To exit, 

type "exit". Note - If you type "bool exit", the application will search for keyword exit.

The time noted has been in my personal machine. (8GB Ram, CORE i5)

In Sun machines, it takes considerably and variably longer time. The total index time varied from 8 minutes to 14 minutes in sun machine.
